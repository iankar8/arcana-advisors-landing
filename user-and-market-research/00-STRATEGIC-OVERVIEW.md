## Key Strategic Decisions Made

### Why Implementation-First (Not Education-First)

**Original Strategy:** Start with AI education platform, upsell to advisory
**Refined Strategy:** Start with implementation + intelligence, potentially add education later

**Reasons for Change:**
1. Banks want deployments NOW, not just education
2. Higher deal velocity ($200K vs. $50K)
3. Implementation revenue funds research investments
4. Each project creates research data and case studies
5. Can build education content from implementation learnings

### Why Research as Differentiator

**Competitive Landscape:**
- Big 4: Slow, expensive, generic consulting
- AI Vendors: Product-biased, vendor lock-in
- Systems Integrators: Technical only, no strategic context

**Our Unique Position:**
- Continuous research on banking AI landscape
- Fast testing and iteration (figure out what works quickly)
- Open-source data + peer-reviewed analysis
- Banking-specific expertise
- 4-8 week deployment (vs. 18 months)

**The Moat:** Only firm combining fast implementation + continuous research-driven iteration + banking specialization

- No internal AI expertise
- Don't want 18-month Big 4 engagement

## Competitive Positioning

| Dimension | Big 4 | AI Vendors | Us |
|-----------|-------|------------|-----|
| **Timeline** | 12-24 months | 3-6 months | 4-8 weeks |
| **Price** | $500K-$2M | $100K-$500K | $150K-$500K |
| **Differentiation** | Brand/scale | Product features | Research-backed |
| **Banking Focus** | Generic | Vertical-agnostic | Banking-only |
| **Independence** | Implementation-biased | Product-biased | Research-driven |
| **Compliance** | Outsourced | Minimal | Built-in day 1 |

**Elevator Pitch:** "We're faster than Big 4, more specialized than vendors, and uniquely research-driven. We iterate faster because we continuously research everything, test quickly, and figure out what works."

## Critical Success Factors

1. **Implementation Quality:** Must deliver on 4-8 week promise with >90% satisfaction
2. **Research Credibility:** Peer-reviewed, open-source data essential for differentiation
3. **Intelligence Value:** Subscribers must see weekly briefs as indispensable
4. **Case Studies:** Need 3-5 referenceable customers by Month 6
5. **Thought Leadership:** Speaking at major banking conferences, published in trade press

---

## Risk Mitigation

**Risk:** Implementation projects overrun timeline/budget
- **Mitigation:** Fixed-scope contracts, proven methodology, weekly check-ins, 20% contingency buffer

**Risk:** Research seen as marketing fluff
- **Mitigation:** Open-source data (GitHub), peer-reviewed by academics, transparent methodology

**Risk:** Intelligence briefing doesn't retain subscribers
- **Mitigation:** High quality from day 1, monthly value surveys, community building through Q&A

**Risk:** Can't differentiate from Big 4 or vendors
- **Mitigation:** Speed advantage (4-8 weeks), research proves independence, banking specialization
