## Risk Mitigation

### Risk: No one wants to pay for education
**Mitigation:** Pilot with discounts, package with advisory, partner with associations

### Risk: Banks won't trust research from small firm
**Mitigation:** Partner with established firm, use academic methodology, publish transparently

### Risk: Advisory doesn't scale
**Mitigation:** Leverage product (education/research/platform), create frameworks, clear scope boundaries

### Risk: Large competitors enter market
**Mitigation:** Go deep on regional banks, build community, specialize vs. generalize

---

## Competitive Landscape

### You vs. Implementation Consultancies (Deloitte, Accenture)
**Your advantage:** Education-first, no vendor lock-in, independent, lower cost

### You vs. Technology Vendors (FIS, Fiserv, nCino)
**Your advantage:** Vendor-neutral, no sales agenda, research-backed, educational

### You vs. Research Firms (Gartner, Forrester, Celent)
**Your advantage:** More tactical, banking-focused, includes advisory, more accessible

### You vs. AI Startups
**Your advantage:** No product to sell, strategic vs. tactical, risk-aware

**The Moat:** Combination of education + advisory + research + experimentation that no one else offers specifically for regional banks

---

## Long-Term Vision (Year 2-3)

### Year 2: $3.5M Revenue
- 100 banks using education platform
- 15 advisory retainer clients
- 30 research subscriptions
- 15 AI experiments conducted

### Year 3: $8M Revenue
- 300 banks using education
- 30 advisory clients
- 100 research subscriptions
- 50 experiments
- **New:** AI Certification program
- **New:** Community platform for banking AI professionals

### Exit Options (if desired)
- Acquisition by Big 4 consultancy (Deloitte, PwC)
- Acquisition by banking association (ABA, ICBA)
- Acquisition by research firm (Gartner, Forrester)
- Merger with complementary service (regulatory compliance, fintech strategy)

---

## Final Thoughts

**The Opportunity:** Regional banks desperately need AI guidance but can't afford (or don't need) Big 4 consultancies. You're positioned to be the trusted voice.

**The Risk:** If you try to be an implementation firm AND an advisor, you'll fail at both. Pick education/advisory and commit.

**The Timeline:** 90 days to prove concept, 6 months to prove revenue, 12 months to prove scalability.

**The Decision:** Read these docs, validate assumptions with 10 conversations with banking executives, then commit to the path.
