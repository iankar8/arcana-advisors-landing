# Positioning Alignment - Implementation + Research Model

## Executive Summary

**Refined Positioning (January 2025):**  
"We help financial institutions learn how to use AI directly in their team's workflow—backed by proprietary research that lets us iterate faster than anyone else."

**Core Business Model:**
- **Primary:** AI implementation services (4-8 week deployments)
- **Differentiator:** Proprietary research on what works/fails in banking AI
- **Supporting:** Intelligence briefing ($10K/year) + Quarterly research reports (lead gen)
- **Primary CTA:** Book technical assessment

## Previous Positioning vs. Refined

### What Changed

- Core: Implementation with learning focus
- Secondary: Education as upsell
- Pitch: "Learn AI implementation in your workflow, backed by research"
- Target: CTO/CIO + CEO (buying committee)

**Why this positioning works:**
- Clear what we do (implement AI in workflow)
- Clear how we're different (research-driven iteration)
- Clear benefit (faster learning, fewer mistakes)
- Authentic (we're learning with you, not claiming to know it all)

### Why We Changed

**Reasons for pivot:**
{{ ... }}
## Messaging Hierarchy

### Level 1: Brand Promise
"AI implementation for banks, backed by research"

### Level 2: Full value proposition:  
"We help financial institutions learn how to use AI directly in their team's workflow. We do proprietary research to stay on top of everything, try things fast, and figure out what works—so we iterate faster than anyone else."

### Level 3: Service-Specific

**For Implementation Buyers:**
"Deploy AI in fraud, compliance, or operations—in 4-8 weeks, not 18 months. Research-backed approach means we know what works before we start."
{{ ... }}
**For Intelligence Subscribers:**
"Stay ahead of AI developments with weekly intelligence briefs and quarterly research reports. Banking-specific, vendor-neutral, research-driven."

**For Research Participants:**
"Help shape the future of AI in banking. Participate in our open-source, peer-reviewed research studies."
