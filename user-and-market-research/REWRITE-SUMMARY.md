# Strategy Docs Rewrite Summary - January 2025

## What Changed and Why

### Core Strategic Pivot

**Original Strategy (Docs written in 2024):**
- Core business: AI Education Platform
- Positioning: "Navigate AI through education, advisory, and research"
- Primary service: AI literacy training programs
- Target: CEOs and training leaders for education programs

**Refined Strategy (January 2025):**
- Core business: AI Implementation Services
- Positioning: "Learn AI implementation in workflow, backed by research"
- Primary service: 4-8 week implementation projects
- Target: CIOs and CEOs for implementation projects

### Why We Changed

1. **Market Demand:** Banks want implementations NOW, not just education
2. **Revenue Velocity:** $200K+ implementation deals vs. $50K education programs
3. **Differentiation:** "Research-backed implementation" is more unique
4. **Cash Flow:** Implementation revenue funds research investments
5. **Scalability:** Can build education later from implementation learnings
