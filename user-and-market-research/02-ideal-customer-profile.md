## Disqualifiers (Who NOT to Target)

### Too Small
- Banks under $500M in assets
- Fintechs under $5M revenue
- Reason: Budget constraints, no dedicated decision-maker

### Too Large
- Banks over $50B in assets (have in-house teams)
- Reason: They'll build internally or hire consultants like McKinsey

### Wrong Mindset
- "Just send us the AI solution"
- Want implementation only, no education/advisory
- Reason: Services mismatch, will be dissatisfied

### No Urgency
- "We're just exploring"
- No board pressure, no competitive threat
- Reason: Won't commit budget, long sales cycle with low close rate
