## Key Risks & Mitigation

- Publish methodology transparently

---

### Risk 3: "Advisory doesn't scale, you become a consultant"
**Mitigation:**
- Leverage product (education, research, platform)
- Create frameworks and playbooks
- Focus on intelligence delivery, not custom projects
- Set clear scope boundaries (no implementation)

---

### Risk 4: "Large competitors enter market"
**Mitigation:**
- Go deep on regional banks (they won't)

## Key Decisions to Make Now

### Decision 1: Which service to build first?
**Recommendation:** AI Education Platform (reasons above)

**Alternative:** Executive Intelligence Briefing (higher margin, but harder to scale)

---

### Decision 2: Self-serve vs. high-touch sales?
**Recommendation:** High-touch for Year 1 (enterprise sales to banks)

**Why:** Banks expect relationships, education needs customization, builds advisory pipeline

---

### Decision 3: Geographic focus or national?
**Recommendation:** Start regional (pick 2-3 states), then expand

**Why:** Easier to build local reputation, leverage state associations, create case studies

---

### Decision 4: Solo vs. build team?
**Recommendation:** Start solo + contractors, hire first employee at $500K ARR

**First hire:** Curriculum designer / education delivery specialist  
**Second hire:** Research analyst (for surveys and reports)  
**Third hire:** Sales/partnerships lead

---

4. **Can you differentiate from consultancies?**
   - Test: Win deals against Deloitte/Accenture/etc.
   - Target: Education-first positioning wins 3+ competitive deals

5. **Will education customers convert to advisory?**
   - Test: Track pilot cohort conversion
   - Target: 30%+ convert within 12 months
