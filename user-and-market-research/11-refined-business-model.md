## Cash Flow Management

### Runway Requirements

**Startup capital needed:** $150K-$200K

- Intelligence subscribers provide recurring revenue

### Revenue Timing

**Implementation:** Lumpy cash flow
- 30% upfront helps
- 40% at midpoint (Week 4)
- 30% at completion (Week 8)

**Intelligence:** Smooth recurring revenue
- Monthly or annual prepay
- Predictable and growing

**Strategy:** Use intelligence revenue to smooth implementation lumpiness

## Competitive Moat

### Why This Model is Defensible

**1. Research creates data moat**
- Proprietary data on what works/fails
- Peer-reviewed credibility
- Continuous learning loop

**2. Implementation experience compounds**
- Each project teaches us more
- Research studies our own projects
- Faster iteration than competitors

**3. Community effects**
- Intelligence subscribers become advocates
- Research participants become network
- Association partnerships create distribution

**4. Banking specialization**
- Deep industry knowledge compounds
- Compliance expertise is barrier to entry
- Can't be easily replicated by generalists

**5. Independence is valuable**
- No vendor to sell = trusted advisor
- Research proves objectivity
- Hard for product companies to compete

## Risks and Mitigation

### Implementation Risk: Projects overrun timeline/budget
**Mitigation:**
- Fixed-price, fixed-scope contracts
- Proven 4-8 week methodology
- Weekly check-ins, early issue detection
- 20% contingency buffer in planning

### Market Risk: Banks stop investing in AI
**Mitigation:**
- Diversified use cases (fraud, compliance, ops)
- Intelligence revenue provides stability
- Can pivot to cost-reduction positioning (vs. growth)

### Competition Risk: Big 4 enters banking AI implementation
**Mitigation:**
- Speed advantage (4-8 weeks vs. 12-24 months)
- Research differentiation (they don't have proprietary data)
- Banking specialization (they're generalists)
- Lower cost ($225K vs. $500K-$2M)

### Talent Risk: Can't hire/retain implementation team
**Mitigation:**
- Strong contractor network
- Compelling mission (research-backed work)
- Profit sharing / equity
- Remote-first = wider talent pool
