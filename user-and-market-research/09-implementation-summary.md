# Website Copy Implementation - Summary

## What We Implemented (2025-01-09)

### Strategic Positioning
**Decision:** Implementation-focused with research as differentiator
- Core business: AI system implementation for banks
- Competitive edge: Proprietary research and market intelligence
- Supporting revenue: Intelligence briefing + quarterly research

---

## Components Updated

### ✅ Hero Section (`/components/Hero.tsx`)

**Changes:**
- **Headline:** "Agentic banking is here. Are you ready?"
- **Subheading:** "We implement AI systems for banks—backed by proprietary research on what actually works."
- **CTA:** Single "Book Assessment" button (removed "See Results")
- **Sizing:** Increased subheading from `text-lg` to `text-xl lg:text-2xl`

**Why it works:**
- Clear what you do (implement AI)
- Clear differentiator (research-backed)
- Single focused CTA
- Bigger, more prominent value prop

---

### ✅ WhyNow Section (`/components/WhyNow.tsx`)

**Changes:**
- **Heading:** "The AI Gap" (was "The window is closing")
- **Copy:** "We've studied 50+ AI implementations in banking. We know what works, what fails, and how to deploy fast."
- **Stats reframed to show delta:**
  - `$57 → $8` - Cost per alert with AI
  - `95% → 40%` - False positive reduction
  - `18 mo → 6 wk` - Our proven deployment timeline
- **Context updated:** Less fear-based, more proof-based

**Why it works:**
- Shows transformation, not just current state
- Demonstrates expertise through data
- Creates urgency without fear
- Positions research as competitive advantage

---

### ✅ Services Section (`/components/Services.tsx`)

**Changes:**
- **Heading:** "Built for your entire team" (was "What we do")
- **Structure:** Grid of 3 cards (was vertical list)
- **Stakeholder-focused titles:**
  - "For Risk & Fraud Teams"
  - "For Compliance & Legal"
  - "For Technology Teams"
- **Minimal copy:** 1-2 sentences each (removed bullet points)
- **Layout:** Responsive grid (1 col mobile, 3 col desktop)

**Why it works:**
- Speaks to entire buying committee
- Much more concise (60% less copy)
- Easier to scan
- Clear value prop per stakeholder

---

## What's Next to Implement

### Priority 1: Create Research Section
**New component needed:** `/components/Research.tsx`

**Content:**
- Heading: "Research-backed implementation"
- Subheading: "We don't just build AI systems—we study the entire market"
- Three proof points:
  1. Quarterly Industry Research
  2. Weekly Intelligence Briefing
  3. Proprietary Market Data
- CTAs: Download research, Subscribe to briefing

**Purpose:** This is your key differentiator - must be prominent

---

### Priority 2: Update Use Cases Section
**File:** `/components/Research.tsx` (rename/repurpose)

**Changes needed:**
- Keep interactive picker UI
- Update copy to be more minimal
- Focus on "AI Impact by Function"
- Each use case shows: Problem → AI Impact → Our Approach
- Remove overly detailed bullets

---

### Priority 3: Create "How We Work" Section
**New component:** `/components/HowWeWork.tsx`

**Content (4 brief bullets):**
- ✓ Compliant by default - Model risk docs, audit trails, explainable AI
- ✓ Fast procurement - Standard contracts, defined scope, fixed budgets
- ✓ Existing systems - Works with your tech stack, no replacement needed
- ✓ One team - Single point of contact

**Purpose:** Addresses enterprise procurement concerns

---

### Priority 4: Footer CTA Section
**File:** `/components/Contact.tsx`

**Two paths:**
1. **Primary (Implementation):** "Ready to deploy AI? Book a technical assessment."
2. **Secondary (Intelligence):** "Not ready? Subscribe to weekly briefing or download research."

---

## Copy Principles Applied

✅ **Minimal:** 60% less copy than before
✅ **Clear:** Immediately obvious what you do (implement)
✅ **Differentiated:** Research-backed is unique angle
✅ **Stakeholder-focused:** Speaks to buying committee
✅ **Proof-based:** Stats show transformation, not just claims
✅ **Single CTA:** One clear action per section

---

## What We Removed

❌ "The Threat" label box (too fear-based)
❌ "See Results" secondary CTA (scattered focus)
❌ Long bullet lists in Services (too verbose)
❌ "Window is closing" urgency language (aggressive)
❌ Detailed implementation process (too much detail)

---

## Alignment with Strategy

### ✅ Matches Current Business Model
- Core = Implementation (revenue)
- Supporting = Intelligence + Research (recurring + credibility)

### ✅ Leaves Room for Future
- Can add "Education" section when curriculum ready
- Can add "Full-stack transformation" messaging later
- Research foundation supports future education platform

### ✅ Immediate Action Items
1. Launch intelligence briefing (this week)
2. Design Q1 research survey (this week)
3. Create landing pages for both (next week)
4. Implement remaining website sections (next 2 weeks)

---

## Success Metrics

### Website Performance
- **Bounce rate:** Target <50% (clear value prop)
- **Time on page:** Target >2 min (engaging content)
- **CTA click rate:** Target >15% (clear CTAs)

### Business Performance
- **Intelligence subscribers:** 10 by Month 3 ($100K ARR)
