## Overview

**Standard Timeline:** 4-8 weeks from kickoff to production
**Average Deal Size:** $150K-$500K
**Success Rate Target:** >90% on-time, on-budget delivery

---

## Week 1: Assessment & Design

### Day 1-2: Kickoff & Discovery
- Stakeholder interviews (Risk, Compliance, Tech, Business)
- Current state documentation review
- Data infrastructure assessment
- Compliance requirements mapping

### Day 3-4: Use Case Prioritization
- Identify quick wins vs. long-term plays
- Data availability check
- Technical feasibility assessment
- ROI estimation

### Day 5: Design Workshop
- Architecture design session
- Model approach selection
- Integration strategy
- Success metrics definition
- Compliance framework design

**Deliverable:** Technical Design Document (TDD) + Project Plan

---

## Week 2-3: Build & Validate

### Development
- Model development/configuration
- Data pipeline setup
- Integration with existing systems
- Model risk documentation (ongoing)

### Testing
- Model validation
- Integration testing
- User acceptance testing (UAT) prep
- Performance benchmarking

**Deliverable:** Working prototype + Model risk documentation draft

---

## Week 4-6: Deploy & Train

### Production Deployment
- Production environment setup
- Model deployment
- Monitoring and alerting setup
- Backup and failover configuration

### Training & Documentation
- End-user training sessions
- Admin runbook creation
- Model governance documentation
- Ongoing monitoring procedures

**Deliverable:** Production system + Complete documentation

---

## Week 7-8: Optimize & Handoff

### Optimization
- Performance tuning based on real data
- False positive reduction
- Model drift monitoring setup
- Feedback loop implementation

### Handoff
- Knowledge transfer sessions
- 30-day support plan
- Quarterly check-in schedule
- Phase 2 roadmap (if applicable)

**Deliverable:** Fully operational system + Support plan

---

## Research-Driven Iteration Approach

### How We Stay Ahead and Iterate Fast

**Learning 1:** Data quality matters more than model sophistication
- **How we apply:** Week 1 deep dive on data infrastructure
- **Why it helps:** Fewer surprises, faster deployment

**Learning 2:** Compliance documentation can't be afterthought
- **How we apply:** Build model risk docs during development (not after)
- **Why it helps:** Ready for audit from day 1

**Learning 3:** User buy-in determines adoption
- **How we apply:** Involve end-users in Week 1 design
- **Why it helps:** Higher adoption rates post-launch

**Learning 4:** Integration is the bottleneck
- **How we apply:** Integration architecture designed in Week 1
- **Why it helps:** No last-minute technical debt

**Learning 5:** Monitoring prevents model drift disasters
- **How we apply:** Monitoring setup in Week 4, not post-launch
- **Why it helps:** Catch issues before they impact business
