## The Gap

### What's Missing from Current Copy:
- **No mention of education** - Currently positioned as implementation firm only
- **No executive advisory angle** - Missing the "keep executives informed" value prop
- **No research/survey capabilities** - Market intelligence completely absent
- **No experimentation platform** - Not positioned as low-risk AI testing ground
- **Wrong primary benefit** - "Deploy faster" vs "Stay informed and prepared"

### Positioning Mismatch:
**Current:** "We build AI systems for you"  
**Should Be:** "We help you understand, evaluate, and thoughtfully adopt AI"

**Current Target:** CTO, Head of Fraud, Chief Risk Officer  
**Should Be:** CEO, COO, Board Members, Policy Leaders + Employee training teams

### Tone Mismatch:
**Current:** Fear-based urgency ("Your competitors are already using AI")  
**Should Be:** Confident guidance ("We'll help you navigate this intelligently")

## Strategic Recommendations

### Phase 1: Core Focus (What to build first)
Pick ONE service to nail:
- **Option A:** AI Education Platform for Bank Employees (scalable, recurring revenue)
- **Option B:** Executive AI Intelligence Briefing (high-value, relationship-driven)
- **Option C:** AI Adoption Research Reports (credibility builder, lead generator)

### Phase 2: Copy Rewrite Priorities
1. **Hero Section:** Change from threat-based to opportunity-based
2. **Services:** Reframe from "implementation" to "guidance + intelligence"
3. **Case Studies:** Replace technical metrics with business outcomes (informed decisions, avoided mistakes, successful pilots)
4. **Social Proof:** Show advisory relationships, not just technical implementations

### Phase 3: Marketing Strategy
**Current perception to create:** "AI implementation shop"  
**Desired perception:** "The trusted guide for banks navigating AI"

**Think:** McKinsey/Gartner/CB Insights hybrid, not an engineering consultancy

## Immediate Next Steps
1. Define the ICP based on actual services (see next document)
2. Create persona profiles for decision-makers
3. Rewrite messaging hierarchy
4. Audit all copy against new positioning
5. Create content calendar that demonstrates expertise (research, education, analysis)
