# Website Copy Rewrites

## Executive Summary

**Core Problem:** Your current website positions Arcana Advisors as an AI implementation firm focused on fraud/compliance. Your actual vision is to be an **AI education, advisory, and research partner** for banks.

**Solution:** Complete messaging overhaul to reflect advisory/education positioning while maintaining professional design and credibility.

---

## Hero Section

### Current Copy (Hero.tsx)
```
Your competitors are already using AI. Are you ready to respond?

The Threat
Deploy compliant AI faster than your fraud moves—without the regulatory risk.

Production-ready AI for fraud, AML, and compliance—shipped in weeks, not years.
```

**Problems:**
- ❌ Fear-based messaging creates anxiety
- ❌ Positions as implementation firm
- ❌ Wrong audience (fraud teams vs. executives)
- ❌ Competitive urgency feels desperate

---

### Recommended Rewrite Option 1 (Confidence-Based)
```
Navigate AI with confidence

The Opportunity
We help banks build AI literacy, make informed decisions, and thoughtfully adopt AI—without betting on unproven technology.

Education. Advisory. Research. Experimentation.
The complete AI intelligence partner for regional banks.
```

**Why Better:**
- ✅ Reduces anxiety, builds confidence
- ✅ Positions as advisor, not vendor
- ✅ Speaks to C-suite decision-makers
- ✅ Lists actual service offerings

---

### Recommended Rewrite Option 2 (Authority-Based)
```
Your trusted guide for AI in banking

The Reality
AI is transforming banking. Your board has questions. Your employees are anxious. Your competitors are experimenting. You need independent guidance.

We provide the AI education, market intelligence, and strategic advisory that banks need to navigate this transformation thoughtfully.
```

**Why Better:**
- ✅ Acknowledges multiple stakeholder concerns
- ✅ Positions as "trusted guide" not "urgent implementer"
- ✅ Independence is key differentiator
- ✅ More consultative tone

---

### Recommended Rewrite Option 3 (Problem-Aware)
```
Most banks face the same AI challenge

You know AI matters. You don't know where to start.
Your board asks for an AI strategy. Your competitors are experimenting. Your employees are anxious about job security. Every vendor claims their solution is "AI-powered."

We help banks navigate this complexity through education, independent research, and strategic advisory—not implementation pressure.
```

**Why Better:**
- ✅ Highly relatable pain points
- ✅ Acknowledges confusion and uncertainty
- ✅ Clear differentiation (education vs. implementation)
- ✅ Empathetic tone

**RECOMMENDATION: Use Option 3** (Most differentiated, addresses real pain)

## Services Section

Services— What we do

1. Stop Fraud Before It Scales
   Bad actors use AI to move faster. We deploy narrow-scope agents...

2. Prove Accuracy to Auditors
   Your regulators will ask how you validated your AI...

3. De-Risk AI in Production
   Every AI decision needs an audit trail...
```

**Problems:**
- ❌ All implementation-focused
- ❌ Technical/tactical, not strategic
- ❌ Assumes customer is already implementing AI
- ❌ No mention of education, advisory, research

## Why Now Section

### Current Copy (WhyNow.tsx)
```
Why Now— The window is closing

Your fraud losses compound while competitors deploy AI defenses. Regulators expect model-risk controls now—not in 2027. Every quarter you wait, adversaries get six months smarter.

We've built the shortcut: production AI in 4–8 weeks, not 24 months.
```

**Problems:**
- ❌ Fear-based and aggressive
- ❌ Implementation timeline focus
- ❌ Doesn't match advisory positioning
- ❌ Creates urgency through threat

---

### Recommended Rewrite

```
Why Now— AI is no longer optional

The banking industry is at an inflection point. Customers expect digital experiences. Fintechs are applying AI to traditional banking functions. Regulators are developing AI risk management frameworks. Your board is asking tough questions.

But here's the challenge: Most banks don't have AI expertise in-house, and most "AI experts" are selling products, not providing independent guidance.

That's where we come in.

We help banks navigate this transformation thoughtfully—building literacy first, making informed decisions second, and implementing (if appropriate) third.

Research— What we're learning about AI in banking

We conduct ongoing research to help the banking industry understand AI opportunities, risks, and adoption patterns. Here's what we're currently studying:

[Horizontal scroll cards - replace current use cases]

CARD 1: Consumer AI Sentiment Study
What do banking customers really think about AI? We surveyed 1,000+ consumers to understand acceptance, concerns, and expectations.

Key Finding: 62% of consumers are comfortable with AI for fraud detection, but only 23% trust AI for loan decisions.

→ Download the full report

---

CARD 2: Regional Bank AI Adoption
How are regional banks approaching AI? We interviewed 50+ banking executives to understand adoption drivers, barriers, and strategies.

Key Finding: 78% of banks cite "lack of internal expertise" as the #1 barrier to AI adoption—not technology or budget.

→ See the research

---

CARD 3: AI Vendor Landscape
We track 200+ AI vendors serving financial institutions. Who's legitimate? Who's hype? We provide independent assessments.

Key Finding: Only 12% of vendors can demonstrate compliant model documentation suitable for regulatory examination.

→ Access the vendor guide

---

CARD 4: AI Use Case Library
We've documented 50+ AI use cases across fraud, compliance, operations, and customer experience—with honest assessments of difficulty, ROI, and risk.

Key Finding: The highest-ROI use cases are often NOT what vendors promote. Document processing beats chatbots by 3x.

→ Browse the library

---

CARD 5: Regulatory Development Tracker
AI regulations are evolving rapidly. We monitor OCC, Fed, CFPB, and international guidance to help you stay ahead of requirements.

Key Finding: Model risk management expectations for AI are stricter than for traditional models—and most banks aren't prepared.

## Principles Section (Rename to "Approach")

### Current Copy (Principles.tsx)
*[Need to read this file to provide rewrite]*

### Recommended Section Concept

```
Our Approach— How we're different

We're not an implementation firm. We're not a software vendor. We're not a generic consultancy.
We're specialized educators and advisors focused exclusively on helping banks navigate AI.

1. Education Before Implementation
   We believe AI literacy must come first. You can't make good decisions about AI without understanding AI. Our education programs build organizational capability that lasts beyond any single project.

2. Independent and Vendor-Neutral
   We don't sell AI software. We don't take implementation revenue. This allows us to provide unbiased guidance on build vs. buy, which vendors to trust, and when to wait.

3. Banking-Specific Expertise
   Generic AI advice doesn't account for banking's unique challenges: regulatory scrutiny, risk management requirements, legacy systems, and compliance expectations. Everything we do is tailored to banking.

4. Research-Backed Guidance
   Our advisory isn't based on theory—it's informed by ongoing research, surveys, and analysis of what's actually working (and failing) in banking AI.

5. Start Small, Prove Value
   We encourage controlled experiments and pilots before major commitments. Learn by doing, but in low-risk environments. Build confidence through evidence.

## Copy Testing Framework

Before going live, test new copy with 5-10 banking executives:

### Questions to Ask:
1. "What do you think we do after reading the homepage?"
2. "Who do you think our ideal customer is?"
3. "How are we different from [competitor]?"
4. "What would make you want to learn more?"
5. "Is there anything confusing or unclear?"

### Success Criteria:
- ✅ 8/10 correctly identify you as educator/advisor (not implementer)
- ✅ 8/10 say messaging reduces anxiety vs. creates it
- ✅ 8/10 can identify one specific service they'd be interested in
- ✅ 8/10 say it feels different from typical vendor sites
