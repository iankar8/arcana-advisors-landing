## 🚀 Implementation Guidelines

### **Adding New Features**

1. **Check DESIGN_SYSTEM.md first**
   - Does it fit the aesthetic?
   - Is there a similar pattern?
   - What are the usage rules?

2. **Review LESSONS_LEARNED.md**
   - Has this been tried before?
   - What were the results?
   - Any cautionary notes?

3. **Build on /demo first**
   - Test interactions in isolation
   - Get feedback before applying
   - Iterate quickly

4. **Apply selectively**
   - Less is more
   - Purposeful over decorative
   - Test with real content

## 📊 Feature Decision Matrix

When evaluating new features, ask:

| Question | Requirement |
|----------|-------------|
| Does it serve a purpose? | Must be YES |
| Is it subtle/tasteful? | Must be YES |
| Could it be gimmicky? | Must be NO |
| Does it distract from content? | Must be NO |
| Works with reduced motion? | Must be YES |
| Fits brand personality? | Must be YES |

**All must pass to implement.**

### **How to Update**
1. Document decisions as they happen
2. Capture "why" not just "what"
3. Include examples and code snippets
4. Update the decision date
5. Cross-reference between docs

## 💡 Philosophy

> "The best interactive elements are the ones users don't consciously notice but subconsciously appreciate. Bold typography and purposeful interactions beat gimmicks every time."

Keep this in mind for every design decision.

## 📞 Questions?

If you're unsure about a design decision:

1. **Does it align with the aesthetic?** → Check DESIGN_SYSTEM.md
2. **Has it been tried before?** → Check LESSONS_LEARNED.md
3. **Still uncertain?** → Build on /demo and test

**Golden Rule:** When in doubt, go subtle. You can always add more, but removing gimmicks is harder.
