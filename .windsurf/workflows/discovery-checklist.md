# AI Agent: New Project Discovery Checklist

**When to use:** User mentions starting a new project, building something, or making major changes.

**My response:** Don't jump to implementation. Ask questions first.

---

## Opening Statement I Should Use

> "Before I start building, I need to understand the full context so I build the right thing. Let me ask you some strategic questions—this will take a few minutes. Ready?"

---

## Phase 1: Business Context (5-10 questions)

**Current State:**
- [ ] "What does your business/project do today?"
- [ ] "What products or services do you currently offer?"
- [ ] "Who are your current customers?"
- [ ] "Can you share your current website/product so I can review it?"

**Future Vision:**
- [ ] "What do you want to build or become?"
- [ ] "How is this different from what you do today?"
- [ ] "What's the timeline for this?"
- [ ] "What should we build FIRST vs. what can come later?"

**The Gap:**
- [ ] "What's the gap between where you are and where you want to be?"
- [ ] "Why does this gap exist?"

**Validate:** Summarize back to them - "Let me make sure I understand: [summary]. Is that right?"

---

## Phase 2: Target Audience (5-8 questions)

**Who It's For:**
- [ ] "Who specifically is this for?" (Push for details)
- [ ] **Critical:** "If you could only design for ONE type of person, who would it be?"

**Problems & Goals:**
- [ ] "What problem are you solving for them?"
- [ ] "What are they doing today instead of your solution?"
- [ ] "What would make them choose you?"

**Decision-Makers:**
- [ ] "Who makes the decision to buy/use this?"
- [ ] "Who actually uses it day-to-day?"

**Red Flag:** If they say "everyone" → push back for specificity

---

## Phase 3: Competition (4-6 questions)

- [ ] "Who are your top 3-5 competitors?"
- [ ] "Can you share their websites so I can review?"
- [ ] "What do they do better? What do you do better?"
- [ ] "What makes you different or unique?"
- [ ] "Complete this: 'Unlike [competitors], we...'"

**My action:** Visit competitor sites and analyze positioning

---

## Phase 4: Messaging (4-6 questions)

- [ ] "How do you WANT to be perceived?"
- [ ] "What's the ONE thing people should remember about you?"
- [ ] "What emotions should they feel? (trust, urgency, innovation)"

**Value Prop Exercise:**
"Let's complete this together:
- We help [WHO]
- [DO WHAT]
- By [HOW]
- Unlike [ALTERNATIVES], we [DIFFERENTIATOR]"

---

## Phase 5: Proof & Credibility (2-4 questions)

- [ ] "What proof points do you have?" (testimonials, case studies, data)
- [ ] "What proof points do you need to build?"
- [ ] "What would make someone trust you?"

---

## Phase 6: Go-to-Market (3-5 questions)

- [ ] "How will people find this?"
- [ ] "Where does your target audience hang out?"
- [ ] "What could attract them?" (tool, report, webinar, guide)
- [ ] "What content exists? What needs to be created?"

---

## Phase 7: Technical (3-5 questions)

- [ ] "What specifically needs to be built?"
- [ ] "Any existing tech stack or integrations?"
- [ ] "Performance or SEO requirements?"
- [ ] "Any technical constraints?"

---

## Phase 8: Design (3-4 questions)

- [ ] "Do you have brand guidelines?" (colors, fonts, logos)
- [ ] "Can you share 2-3 websites you love and why?"
- [ ] "What design style appeals to you?"
- [ ] "Mobile vs. desktop priority?"

---

## Phase 9: Constraints (4-6 questions)

- [ ] "What's the deadline? (hard or soft?)"
- [ ] "Any budget constraints?"

**For each feature/section:**
- [ ] "Is this essential for launch?"
- [ ] "Can this be added later?"
- [ ] "What's the impact vs. effort?"

**Prioritization:**
- [ ] "What's the MINIMUM we need to launch?" (Phase 1)
- [ ] "What comes after validation?" (Phase 2)
- [ ] "What's needed for scale?" (Phase 3)

---

## Phase 10: Success Metrics (3-4 questions)

- [ ] "What does success look like in 6 months? 12 months?"
- [ ] "What metrics matter most?"
- [ ] "What would make this a failure?"

---

## My Documentation Deliverables

After discovery, I create these documents BEFORE any code:

1. **Gap Analysis** - Current vs. future state, what needs to change
2. **ICP & Personas** - Detailed customer profiles (3-5 personas)
3. **Messaging Framework** - Positioning, value props, tone
4. **Go-to-Market Strategy** - Phased plan, channels, metrics, 90-day plan
5. **Copy Recommendations** - Before/after for key sections
6. **README** - How to use the docs, next steps

---

## My Quality Checklist

Before showing strategy docs, verify:

- [ ] Can I clearly explain their business in 2 sentences?
- [ ] Can I identify the #1 customer persona?
- [ ] Can I articulate their key differentiator?
- [ ] Do I know what to build first (and why)?
- [ ] Do I understand what success looks like?
- [ ] Are docs actionable and realistic?
- [ ] Have I made any assumptions that need validation?

---

## Red Flags & My Responses

| Red Flag | My Response |
|----------|-------------|
| "I want to serve everyone" | "Let's start with the most important segment. If you could only help ONE type first, who would it be?" |
| "Differentiator is quality" | "Everyone claims quality. What specifically about your quality is different? Give me a concrete example." |
| "Just make it modern" | "Modern is subjective. Let's talk about your business goals first. Who are we designing for?" |
| "I need this ASAP" | "Let me help you prioritize what's essential vs. what can come later. Fast, good, cheap—pick two." |
| "I'll know it when I see it" | "Let's establish clear criteria now: What are 3 things that would make you say 'yes, perfect'?" |
| "Do whatever you think" | "I need your input—you're the expert on what your customers need. Let's work through this together." |

## Success Indicators

### Good Discovery:
- ✅ User says "You really get it"
- ✅ They give specific examples (not vague generalities)
- ✅ They can name their ideal customer specifically
- ✅ They know what competitors are doing
- ✅ Clear priorities emerge
- ✅ Few direction changes during implementation

### Need to Improve:
- ❌ User keeps changing requirements mid-project
- ❌ Target audience keeps shifting
- ❌ Messaging feels generic
- ❌ Major pivots required after showing work
- ❌ Lots of rework

---

## Example: Good vs. Bad Response

### User Says:
> "I want to build a website for my business"

### ❌ Bad AI Response:
> "Great! What colors do you like?"

### ✅ Good AI Response:
> "Before I start building, let me understand your business and goals. 
> 
> First, what does your business do today? Who are your customers? What problem do you solve for them?
> 
> Then I'll ask about your vision, competitors, and what success looks like. This will ensure I build the right thing."

---

## Quick Reminder for Myself

**Don't code first. Strategy first.**

1. Ask comprehensive questions (all phases)
2. Create strategy documents (6 core docs)
3. Present for approval
4. THEN implement

Better to spend hours in discovery than weeks in rework.
